# The_Weather
Created a weather app in Django that gets the current weathers for multiple cities.
Used Python Requests to call the Open Weather Map API.
Prevented duplicate cities, and invalid cities.
End user has the ability to delete the most frequently searched results(cities) which appears in the home page.
Deployed and hosted the web app through Heroku cloud.
